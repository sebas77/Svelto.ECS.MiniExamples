//Note on this example:
//When developing with svelto the user would need to plan a bit what entities need to be used and
//what behaviours these entities will have. Engines can be added over the time, so the key is to have
//a good idea of the entities to work on. All the reasonings should always start from the EntityDescriptors
//Entity Components can be added over the time of course, but it's important to establish what entities
//will come into play.
//The key entities (and relative entity descriptors) for this demo are:
//Player
//PlayerGun
//Enemy
//Camera
//HUD
//Once the first entity descriptors are designed, it becomes simpler to start build these entities and
//write the engines for their behaviours.

//Note: this demo relies heavily on the publisher/consumer pattern. Engines can iterate quickly over entities
//but when they react on entity changes, iterating all the entities can be a waste. Relying too much on the
//publisher/consumer can have some drawbacks, so with Svelto.ECS 3.0 filters can be used instead. This doesn't
//mean that filters are better than the publisher/consumer model. Each tool must be used wisely.

//Main is the Application Composition Root. A Composition Root is the where all the dependencies are 
//created and injected (I talk a lot about this in my articles) A composition root belongs to the Context, but
//a context can have more than a composition root. For example a factory is a composition root.
//Furthermore an application can have more than a context/composition root but this is more advanced and not part of this demo
